My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
Next year, I want to level up both personally and academically.
I’m planning to stay more disciplined, keep my study schedule tight,
and really work on managing my time. Personally,
I want to build more positive routines and stay focused on becoming a better version of myself.
